# Wind Turbine Fault Detection using SCADA Sensor Data

This project focuses on analyzing time-series SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) sensor data collected from wind turbines to predict operational faults and performance anomalies. It demonstrates end-to-end data science and machine learning practices including data wrangling, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on industrial IoT data and real-time system monitoring.
